# Billing Subscription Service

## Overview
The Billing Subscription Service tracks usage and manages billing plans for tenants. It ensures accurate billing based on resource consumption and provides subscription management features.

## Features
- Usage tracking for cloud resources.
- Support for multiple billing plans (e.g., pay-as-you-go, fixed pricing).
- Integration with payment gateways.

## High-Level Approach
1. **Usage Tracking**:
   - Collect usage metrics from other services.
   - Store metrics in a time-series database.

2. **Billing Logic**:
   - Calculate costs based on predefined plans.
   - Handle prorated billing for mid-cycle changes.

3. **API Design**:
   - Provide endpoints for fetching billing details and managing subscriptions.
   - Ensure APIs are secure and tenant-isolated.

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for billing calculations.
   - Use integration tests to validate data flow from other services.
