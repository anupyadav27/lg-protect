- `aws_service_coverage_analysis.md` - Analysis of AWS service coverage
- `aws_service_scan_summary.md` - Summary of AWS service scanning results
- `inventory_service_summary.md` - Summary of inventory service functionality

### 📁 Test Files → `tests/`

#### `tests/integration/`
- `test_inventory_data.py` - Integration tests for inventory data functionality
- `test_aws_discovery.py` - Integration tests for AWS discovery functionality
- `test_inventory_functionality.py` - Integration tests for inventory service functionality

#### `tests/results/`
- `inventory_data_test_results.json` - Test results for inventory data tests
- `aws_discovery_test_results.json` - Test results for AWS discovery tests
- `inventory_test_results.json` - Test results for inventory functionality tests

## Files Removed

### 🗑️ Unnecessary Files

## Benefits of Organization

### ✅ **Clean Main Directory**
- Only essential project files remain in the root
- Easy to find important files like README and requirements

### ✅ **Logical File Organization**
- Documentation in `docs/` with proper subdirectories
- Tests in `tests/` with results in `tests/results/`
- Clear separation of concerns

### ✅ **Better Maintainability**
- Related files are grouped together
- Easier to find specific documentation or tests
- Reduced clutter in main directory

### ✅ **Professional Structure**
- Follows standard project organization practices
- Makes the project more professional and organized
- Easier for new contributors to navigate

## Next Steps

1. **Update Documentation**: Update any references to moved files
2. **Update Scripts**: Ensure any scripts that reference moved files are updated
3. **Update CI/CD**: Update any CI/CD pipelines that might reference moved files
4. **Team Communication**: Inform team members about the new file organization

## Migration Status

- ✅ **Completed**: File organization and cleanup
- ✅ **Verified**: All files moved to appropriate locations
- ✅ **Cleaned**: Removed unnecessary system files
- ✅ **Documented**: Created organization summary

The project now has a clean, professional structure that follows best practices for file organization.
