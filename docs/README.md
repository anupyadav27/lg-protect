## 🔄 Event-Driven Architecture

### Core Event Flow
```
1. Resource Discovery → Event Bus → Compliance Validation
2. Compliance Violations → Event Bus → Alert Engine
3. Real-time Events → WebSocket → Client Updates
4. Audit Trail → Event Bus → Report Generation
```

### Event Types
- `INVENTORY_DISCOVERED` - AWS resources found
- `COMPLIANCE_VIOLATION` - Policy violation detected
- `ALERT_TRIGGERED` - Security alert generated
- `SCAN_COMPLETED` - Scan finished with results

## 🛠️ Service Architecture
