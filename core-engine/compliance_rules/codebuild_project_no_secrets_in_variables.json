  "Name": "Using strong cryptography, render all authentication credentials (such as passwords/phrases) unreadable during transmission and storage on all system components",
  "Description": "Many network devices and applications transmit unencrypted, readable passwords across the network and/or store passwords without encryption. A malicious individual can easily intercept unencrypted passwords during transmission using a \u201csniffer,\u201d or directly access unencrypted passwords in files where they are stored, and use this data to gain unauthorized access. Note: Testing Procedures 8.2.1.d and 8.2.1.e are additional procedures that only apply if the entity being assessed is a service provider.",
