  "Name": "Inspector2 Is Enabled",
  "Description": "Define a mechanism and frequency to scan and patch for vulnerabilities in your dependencies, and in your operating systems to help protect against new threats. Scan and patch your dependencies, and your operating systems on a defined schedule. Software vulnerability management is essential to keeping your system secure from threat actors. Embedding vulnerability assessments early into your continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline allows you to prioritize remediation of any security vulnerabilities detected. The solution you need to achieve this varies according to the AWS services that you are consuming. To check for vulnerabilities in software running in Amazon EC2 instances, you can add Amazon Inspector to your pipeline to cause your build to fail if Inspector detects vulnerabilities. You can also use open source products such as OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, OpenVAS, package managers and AWS Partner tools for vulnerability management.",
