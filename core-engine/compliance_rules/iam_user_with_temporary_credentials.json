  "Name": "Use temporary credentials",
  "Description": "Use temporary security credentials to access AWS resources. For machine identities within AWS (for example, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances or AWS Lambda functions), always use IAM roles to acquire temporary security credentials. For machine identities running outside of AWS, use IAM Roles Anywhere or securely store static AWS access keys that are only used to assume an IAM role.For human identities, use AWS IAM Identity Center or other identity federation solutions where possible. If you must use static AWS access keys for human users, require MFA for all access, including the AWS Management Console, and AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).",
