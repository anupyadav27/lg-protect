# Compliance Engine Tests

This directory contains validation tests for the AWS Compliance Engine components.

## 📁 Test Structure

The test directory has been optimized and contains only essential files:

- **`direct_component_test.py`** - Core validation test that verifies all compliance engine components
- **`run_validation.py`** - Simple test runner script
- **`.gitignore`** - Prevents cache files from being committed

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Quick Validation
```bash
# Run the validation test
python tests/run_validation.py

# Or run directly
python tests/direct_component_test.py
```

## 🧪 What Gets Tested

The validation test verifies:
- **File Structure** - All compliance engine modules exist
- **Syntax Validation** - All Python files have valid syntax
- **Core Logic** - Key functionality works correctly
- **Component Initialization** - All classes can be instantiated

## 📊 Expected Output

```
🧪 DIRECT COMPLIANCE ENGINE COMPONENT TESTING
============================================================

📁 File Existence and Structure Check:
   ✅ aws_session_manager.py
   ✅ error_handler.py
   ✅ config_utils.py
   ✅ account_manager.py
   ✅ compliance_engine.py

🔍 Syntax Validation:
   ✅ All modules have valid syntax

⚙️ Core Logic Tests:
   ✅ Service extraction works correctly

📊 VALIDATION SUMMARY:
   File Structure: ✅ PASS
   Syntax Check: ✅ PASS
   Core Logic: ✅ PASS

🎯 OVERALL STATUS: ✅ READY FOR USE
```

## 🎯 Test Philosophy

This streamlined approach focuses on:
- **Essential Validation** - Verify core functionality works
- **Simple Execution** - Easy to run and understand
- **No Complex Dependencies** - Minimal setup required
- **Clean Structure** - No unnecessary test files

## 🧹 Cleanup Notes

The test directory has been cleaned up to remove:
- Incompatible test files with API mismatches
- Redundant test runners
- Python cache directories (`__pycache__`)
- Complex test suites that didn't align with the actual implementation

This ensures a focused, maintainable test structure that actually works with the compliance engine as implemented.
