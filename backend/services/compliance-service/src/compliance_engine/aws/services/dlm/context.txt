WS Services Standardization Context & Progress Tracker
üìã CONTEXT SUMMARY
Goal: Standardize all AWS service files to follow the clean architecture pattern:
Service files: Data collection only (no compliance logic)
Individual rules: Rich compliance checks with metadata
No duplication: Single source of truth for each compliance check
Reference Pattern: accessanalyzer/ service (already cleaned up)

üîß STANDARDIZATION CHECKLIST FOR EACH SERVICE
Service File Requirements:
[ ] Inherits from BaseService
[ ] Implements _get_service_name() method
[ ] NO run_compliance_checks() method
[ ] NO _check_*() methods
[ ] ONLY data collection methods
[ ] Has get_all_[resources]() method for individual rules
Individual Rules Requirements:
[ ] Inherit from BaseCheck
[ ] Implement _get_metadata() method
[ ] Implement execute() method
[ ] Use service for data collection
[ ] Return CheckReport objects with rich metadata
ÔøΩÔøΩ STARTING WITH: ACM SERVICE
üîç ACM SERVICE ANALYSIS
Current State Assessment:
‚ùå Issues Found:
Service File Issues:
‚ùå Does NOT inherit from BaseService
‚ùå Class name is ACMService instead of ACMService
‚ùå No _get_service_name() method
‚ùå No get_all_certificates(region) method for individual rules
Individual Rule Issues:
‚ùå Uses acm_client.certificates.values() instead of service
‚ùå Missing proper service integration
‚úÖ Good Parts:
‚úÖ Has proper data models (Certificate)
‚úÖ Has individual rule folders
‚úÖ Individual rules inherit from BaseCheck
‚úÖ Individual rules have rich metadata
üîß ACM SERVICE CLEANUP PLAN
Step 1: Fix Service File
Tool edit_file not found. Try switching to Agent mode.
I apologize for the confusion. Let me continue with the analysis and provide you with the exact changes needed for the ACM service.

üìä UPDATED PROGRESS TRACKER
‚úÖ COMPLETED SERVICES
accessanalyzer - ‚úÖ Cleaned up (reference pattern)
account - ‚úÖ Already clean structure
ÔøΩÔøΩ CURRENT SERVICE: acm - ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS CLEANUP
Issues Found:
‚ùå Service doesn't inherit from BaseService
‚ùå No _get_service_name() method
‚ùå No get_all_certificates(region) method
‚ùå Individual rules don't use service properly
Changes Needed:
Fix service inheritance and methods
Update individual rules to use service
Add proper region handling
‚è≥ NEXT SERVICE: apigatewayv2 (After ACM is fixed)
ÔøΩÔøΩ CONTEXT FOR RESUMPTION
Current Status: Analyzing ACM service for cleanup
Next Action: Fix ACM service file and individual rules
Progress: 2/81 services completed (2.5%)
Key Points for Continuation:
ACM service needs BaseService inheritance
Add get_all_certificates(region) method
Update individual rules to use service instead of client
Follow the same pattern as accessanalyzer service
Quality Standards:
‚úÖ No duplicate compliance logic in service files
‚úÖ Individual rules use service for data collection
‚úÖ Rich metadata in individual rules
‚úÖ Proper error handling and logging
Would you like me to continue with the detailed fix for ACM service, or would you prefer to handle this one and then pass the context back to me for the next service?
