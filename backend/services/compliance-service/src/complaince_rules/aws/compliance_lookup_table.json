AWS CloudFormation Guard can help you verify that CloudFormation templates are safe, save you time, and reduce the risk of configuration error.Reducing the number of security misconfigurations introduced into a production environment is critical—the more quality control and reduction of defects you can perform in the build process, the better. Design continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to test for security issues whenever possible. CI/CD pipelines offer the opportunity to enhance security at each stage of build and delivery. CI/CD security tooling must also be kept updated to mitigate evolving threats.Track changes to your workload configuration to help with compliance auditing, change management, and investigations that may apply to you. You can use AWS Config to record and evaluate your AWS and third-party resources. It allows you to continuously audit and assess the overall compliance with rules and conformance packs, which are collections of rules with remediation actions.Change tracking should include planned changes, which are part of your organization's change control process (sometimes referred to as MACD—Move, Add, Change, Delete), unplanned changes, and unexpected changes, such as incidents. Changes might occur on the infrastructure, but they might also be related to other categories, such as changes in code repositories, machine images and application inventory changes, process and policy changes, or documentation changes."

    "description": "For workforce identities, rely on an identity provider that enables you to manage identities in a centralized place. This makes it easier to manage access across multiple applications and services, because you are creating, managing, and revoking access from a single location. For example, if someone leaves your organization, you can revoke access for all applications and services (including AWS) from one location. This reduces the need for multiple credentials and provides an opportunity to integrate with existing human resources (HR) processes. For federation with individual AWS accounts, you can use centralized identities for AWS with a SAML 2.0-based provider with AWS Identity and Access Management. You can use any provider— whether hosted by you in AWS, external to AWS, or supplied by the AWS Partner—that is compatible with the SAML 2.0 protocol. You can use federation between your AWS account and your chosen provider to grant a user or application access to call AWS API operations by using a SAML assertion to get temporary security credentials. Web-based single sign-on is also supported, allowing users to sign in to the AWS Management Console from your sign in website. For federation to multiple accounts in your AWS Organizations, you can configure your identity source in AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (IAM Identity Center), and specify where your users and groups are stored. Once configured, your identity provider is your source of truth, and information can be synchronized using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) v2.0 protocol. You can then look up users or groups and grant them IAM Identity Center access to AWS accounts, cloud applications, or both. IAM Identity Center integrates with AWS Organizations, which enables you to configure your identity provider once and then grant access to existing and new accounts managed in your organization. IAM Identity Center provides you with a default store, which you can use to manage your users and groups. If you choose to use the IAM Identity Center store, create your users and groups and assign their level of access to your AWS accounts and applications, keeping in mind the best practice of least privilege. Alternatively, you can choose to Connect to Your External Identity Provider using SAML 2.0, or Connect to Your Microsoft AD Directory using AWS Directory Service. Once configured, you can sign into the AWS Management Console, or the AWS mobile app, by authenticating through your central identity provider. For managing end-users or consumers of your workloads, such as a mobile app, you can use Amazon Cognito. It provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. Your users can sign in directly with sign-in credentials, or through a third party, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, or Google."

For human identities, you should require users to change their passwords periodically and retire access keys in favor of temporary credentials.

You can use AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (IAM Identity Center) to manage user groups and attributes.

    "description": "Security operations teams rely on the collection of logs and the use of search tools to discover potential events of interest, which might indicate unauthorized activity or unintentional change. However, simply analyzing collected data and manually processing information is insufficient to keep up with the volume of information flowing from complex architectures. Analysis and reporting alone don't facilitate the assignment of the right resources to work an event in a timely fashion. A best practice for building a mature security operations team is to deeply integrate the flow of security events and findings into a notification and workflow system such as a ticketing system, a bug or issue system, or other security information and event management (SIEM) system. This takes the workflow out of email and static reports, and allows you to route, escalate, and manage events or findings. Many organizations are also integrating security alerts into their chat or collaboration, and developer productivity platforms. For organizations embarking on automation, an API-driven, low-latency ticketing system offers considerable flexibility when planning what to automate first. This best practice applies not only to security events generated from log messages depicting user activity or network events, but also from changes detected in the infrastructure itself. The ability to detect change, determine whether a change was appropriate, and then route that information to the correct remediation workflow is essential in maintaining and validating a secure architecture, in the context of changes where the nature of their undesirability is sufficiently subtle that their execution cannot currently be prevented with a combination of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and AWS Organizations configuration. Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub provide aggregation, deduplication, and analysis mechanisms for log records that are also made available to you via other AWS services. GuardDuty ingests, aggregates, and analyzes information from sources such as AWS CloudTrail management and data events, VPC DNS logs, and VPC Flow Logs. Security Hub can ingest, aggregate, and analyze output from GuardDuty, AWS Config, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Firewall Manager, and a significant number of third-party security products available in the AWS Marketplace, and if built accordingly, your own code. Both GuardDuty and Security Hub have an Administrator-Member model that can aggregate findings and insights across multiple accounts, and Security Hub is often used by customers who have an on- premises SIEM as an AWS-side log and alert preprocessor and aggregator from which they can then ingest Amazon EventBridge through a AWS Lambda-based processor and forwarder."

This service provides a scalable rules engine designed to broker both native AWS event formats (such as AWS CloudTrail events), as well as custom events you can generate from your application. Amazon GuardDuty also allows you to route events to a workflow system for those building incident response systems (AWS Step Functions), or to a central Security Account, or to a bucket for further analysis. Detecting change and routing this information to the correct workflow can also be accomplished using AWS Config Rules and Conformance Packs. AWS Config detects changes to in-scope services (though with higher latency than EventBridge) and generates events that can be parsed using AWS Config Rules for rollback, enforcement of compliance policy, and forwarding of information to systems, such as change management platforms and operational ticketing systems. As well as writing your own Lambda functions to respond to AWS Config events, you can also take advantage of the AWS Config Rules Development Kit, and a library of open source AWS Config Rules. Conformance packs are a collection of AWS Config Rules and remediation actions you deploy as a single entity authored as a YAML template.

For example, a database cluster in a virtual private cloud (VPC) with no need for internet access should be placed in subnets with no route to or from the internet. In a serverless workload operating without a VPC, similar layering and segmentation with microservices can achieve the same goal. Components such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database clusters, and AWS Lambda functions that share reachability requirements can be segmented into layers formed by subnets. For example, an Amazon RDS database cluster in a VPC with no need for internet access should be placed in subnets with no route to or from the internet. This layered approach for the controls mitigates the impact of a single layer misconfiguration, which could allow unintended access. For Lambda, you can run your functions in your VPC to take advantage of VPC-based controls. For network connectivity that can include thousands of VPCs, AWS accounts, and on-premises networks, you should use AWS Transit Gateway. It acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks, which act like spokes. Traffic between an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud and AWS Transit Gateway remains on the AWS private network, which reduces external threat vectors such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and common exploits, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, or abuse of broken authentication code. AWS Transit Gateway inter-region peering also encrypts inter-region traffic with no single point of failure or bandwidth bottleneck."

    "description": "When architecting your network topology, you should examine the connectivity requirements of each component. For example, if a component requires internet accessibility (inbound and outbound), connectivity to VPCs, edge services, and external data centers. A VPC allows you to define your network topology that spans an AWS Region with a private IPv4 address range that you set, or an IPv6 address range AWS selects. You should apply multiple controls with a defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic, including the use of security groups (stateful inspection firewall), Network ACLs, subnets, and route tables. Within a VPC, you can create subnets in an Availability Zone. Each subnet can have an associated route table that defines routing rules for managing the paths that traffic takes within the subnet. You can define an internet routable subnet by having a route that goes to an internet or NAT gateway attached to the VPC, or through another VPC. When an instance, Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS) database, or other service is launched within a VPC, it has its own security group per network interface. This firewall is outside the operating system layer and can be used to define rules for allowed inbound and outbound traffic. You can also define relationships between security groups. For example, instances within a database tier security group only accept traffic from instances within the application tier, by reference to the security groups applied to the instances involved. Unless you are using non-TCP protocols, it shouldn't be necessary to have an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance directly accessible by the internet (even with ports restricted by security groups) without a load balancer, or CloudFront. This helps protect it from unintended access through an operating system or application issue. A subnet can also have a network ACL attached to it, which acts as a stateless firewall. You should configure the network ACL to narrow the scope of traffic allowed between layers, note that you need to define both inbound and outbound rules. Some AWS services require components to access the internet for making API calls, where AWS API endpoints are located. Other AWS services use VPC endpoints within your Amazon VPCs. Many AWS services, including Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB, support VPC endpoints, and this technology has been generalized in AWS PrivateLink. We recommend you use this approach to access AWS services, third-party services, and your own services hosted in other VPCs securely. All network traffic on AWS PrivateLink stays on the global AWS backbone and never traverses the internet. Connectivity can only be initiated by the consumer of the service, and not by the provider of the service. Using AWS PrivateLink for external service access allows you to create air-gapped VPCs with no internet access and helps protect your VPCs from external threat vectors. Third-party services can use AWS PrivateLink to allow their customers to connect to the services from their VPCs over private IP addresses. For VPC assets that need to make outbound connections to the internet, these can be made outbound only (one-way) through an AWS managed NAT gateway, outbound only internet gateway, or web proxies that you create and manage."

Start by reducing unused components, whether they are operating system packages or applications, for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)-based workloads, or external software modules in your code, for all workloads. You can find many hardening and security configuration guides for common operating systems and server software. For example, you can start with the Center for Internet Security and iterate.In Amazon EC2, you can create your own Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which you have patched and hardened, to help you meet the specific security requirements for your organization. The patches and other security controls you apply on the AMI are effective at the point in time in which they were created—they are not dynamic unless you modify after launching, for example, with AWS Systems Manager.You can simplify the process of building secure AMIs with EC2 Image Builder. EC2 Image Builder significantly reduces the effort required to create and maintain golden images without writing and maintaining automation. When software updates become available, Image Builder automatically produces a new image without requiring users to manually initiate image builds. EC2 Image Builder allows you to easily validate the functionality and security of your images before using them in production with AWS-provided tests and your own tests. You can also apply AWS-provided security settings to further secure your images to meet internal security criteria. For example, you can produce images that conform to the Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) standard using AWS-provided templates.Using third-party static code analysis tools, you can identify common security issues such as unchecked function input bounds, as well as applicable common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). You can use Amazon CodeGuru for supported languages. Dependency checking tools can also be used to determine whether libraries your code links against are the latest versions, are themselves free of CVEs, and have licensing conditions that meet your software policy requirements.Using Amazon Inspector, you can perform configuration assessments against your instances for known CVEs, assess against security benchmarks, and automate the notification of defects. Amazon Inspector runs on production instances or in a build pipeline, and it notifies developers and engineers when findings are present.

When you build security automation, your system can monitor, review, and initiate a response, rather than having people monitor your security position and manually react to events. An effective way to automatically provide searchable and relevant log data across AWS services to your incident responders is to enable Amazon Detective.If your incident response teams continue to respond to alerts in the same way, they risk alert fatigue. Over time, the team can become desensitized to alerts and can either make mistakes handling ordinary situations or miss unusual alerts. Automation helps avoid alert fatigue by using functions that process the repetitive and ordinary alerts, leaving humans to handle the sensitive and unique incidents. Integrating anomaly detection systems, such as Amazon GuardDuty, AWS CloudTrail Insights, and Amazon CloudWatch Anomaly Detection, can reduce the burden of common threshold-based alerts.You can improve manual processes by programmatically automating steps in the process. After you define the remediation pattern to an event, you can decompose that pattern into actionable logic, and write the code to perform that logic. Responders can then execute that code to remediate the issue. Over time, you can automate more and more steps, and ultimately automatically handle whole classes of common incidents.For tools that execute within the operating system of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, you should evaluate using the AWS Systems Manager Run Command, which enables you to remotely and securely administrate instances using an agent that you install on your Amazon EC2 instance operating system.

Developing a simulation activity that is both realistic and beneficial can be a difficult exercise. Although testing your procedures or automation that handles well-understood events has certain advantages, it is just as valuable to participate in creative Security Incident Response Simulations (SIRS) activities to test yourself against the unexpected and continuously improve.Create custom simulations tailored to your environment, team, and tools. Find an issue and design your simulation around it. This could be something like a leaked credential, a server communicating with unwanted systems, or a misconfiguration that results in unauthorized exposure. Identify engineers who are familiar with your organization to create the scenario and another group to participate. The scenario should be realistic and challenging enough to be valuable. It should include the opportunity to get hands on with logging, notifications, escalations, and executing runbooks or automation. During the simulation, your responders should exercise their technical and organizational skills, and leaders should be involved to build their incident management skills. At the end of the simulation, celebrate the efforts of the team and look for ways to iterate, repeat, and expand into further simulations.AWS has created Incident Response Runbook templates that you can use not only to prepare your response efforts, but also as a basis for a simulation. When planning, a simulation can be broken into five phases.Evidence gathering: In this phase, a team will get alerts through various means, such as an internal ticketing system, alerts from monitoring tooling, anonymous tips, or even public news. Teams then start to review infrastructure and application logs to determine the source of the compromise. This step should also involve internal escalations and incident leadership. Once identified, teams move on to containing the incidentContain the incident: Teams will have determined there has been an incident and established the source of the compromise. Teams now should take action to contain it, for example, by disabling compromised credentials, isolating a compute resource, or revoking a role's permission.Eradicate the incident: Now that they've contained the incident, teams will work towards mitigating any vulnerabilities in applications or infrastructure configurations that were susceptible to the compromise. This could include rotating all credentials used for a workload, modifying Access Control Lists (ACLs) or changing network configurations."

This can speed up the lifecycle of a response. The next goal is to enable this code to be fully automated by being invoked by the alerts or events themselves, rather than by a human responder, to create an event-driven response. These processes should also automatically add relevant data to your security systems. For example, an incident involving traffic from an unwanted IP address can automatically populate an AWS WAF block list or Network Firewall rule group to prevent further activity.With an event-driven response system, a detective mechanism triggers a responsive mechanism to automatically remediate the event. You can use event-driven response capabilities to reduce the time-to-value between detective mechanisms and responsive mechanisms. To create this event-driven architecture, you can use AWS Lambda, which is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. For example, assume that you have an AWS account with the AWS CloudTrail service enabled. If CloudTrail is ever disabled (through the cloudtrail:StopLogging API call), you can use Amazon EventBridge to monitor for the specific cloudtrail:StopLogging event, and invoke a Lambda function to call cloudtrail:StartLogging to restart logging."

When you automate regression testing, you can rerun functional and non-functional tests to verify that previously tested software still performs as expected after a change. When you define security unit tests to check for common misconfigurations, such as broken or missing authentication, you can identify and fix these issues early in the development process. Test automation uses purpose-built test cases for application validation, based on the application’s requirements and desired functionality. The result of the automated testing is based on comparing the generated test output to its respective expected output, which expedites the overall testing lifecycle. Testing methodologies such as regression testing and unit test suites are best suited for automation. Automating the testing of security properties allows builders to receive automated feedback without having to wait for a security review.

Flow control restrictions include the following: keeping exportcontrolled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet; blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization; restricting requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server; and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packetfiltering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Transferring information between systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes: prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels."

Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems. Security functions include establishing system accounts, setting events to be logged, setting intrusion detection parameters, and configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges). Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from having access to privileged information or functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of this requirement between allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control system configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk."

Note that this requirement represents a condition to be achieved by the definition of authorized privileges in 3.1.2. Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.

The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate control (e.g., employing encryption techniques for confidentiality protection), may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyberattacks and help to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote users on a variety of system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets)."

    "description": "External systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and controls or the determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems. External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices and privately-owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities. This requirement also addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI, including accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational systems. Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum, the types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems. This requirement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational systems. In those situations, organizations need confidence that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required controls have been effectively implemented can be achieved by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the assurance or confidence level required by organizations. Note that while “external” typically refers to outside of the organization's direct supervision and authority, that is not always the case. Regarding the protection of CUI across an organization, the organization may have systems that process CUI and others that do not. And among the systems that process CUI there are likely access restrictions for CUI that apply between systems. Therefore, from the perspective of a given system, other systems within the organization may be considered 'external' to that system."

Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, administrative privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the CUI security requirements. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of event types, the logging necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented or cloudbased architectures. Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes time stamps, source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, success or fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the system after the event occurred). Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records includes full text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit log information to only that information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest. Audit logs are reviewed and analyzed as often as needed to provide important information to organizations to facilitate risk-based decision making."

Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be defined include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, input and output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security requirements. Security parameters include: registry settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and settings for functions, ports, protocols, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors."

Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. It is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single system components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per component. Organizations review functions and services provided by systems or components of systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services."

In addition to authenticating users at the system level (i.e., at logon), organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security. Access to organizational systems is defined as local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks. The use of encrypted virtual private networks for connections between organization-controlled and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks with regard to protecting the confidentiality of information."

The vulnerabilities to be scanned are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This process ensures that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes: scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated, scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention, and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of system vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Security assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive or the system component that is the subject of the scanning may contain highly sensitive information. Privileged access authorization to selected system components facilitates thorough vulnerability scanning and protects the sensitive nature of such scanning."

Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in other established management/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition.

    "description": "Designated locations include system entry and exit points which may include firewalls, remoteaccess servers, workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputationbased technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended."

    "name": "3.14.6 Monitor organizational systems, including inbound and outbound communications traffic, to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks",
    "description": "System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations can monitor systems, for example, by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. System monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of monitoring information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. System monitoring is an integral part of continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless. Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound/outbound communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in systems or propagating among system components, the unauthorized exporting of information, or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify potentially compromised systems or system components. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements."
