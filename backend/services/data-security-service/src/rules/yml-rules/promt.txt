Final AI Prompt ‚Äì CSPM Rule Generator with Services, Categories, Risk Levels & Existing Rule Support

You are a cloud security expert developing rules for data security for a CSPM platform (like Wiz, Prisma, or Orca Security).

Your task is to generate a high-quality list of **rule definitions** for a specific AWS service, covering:
- Strong data security misconfigurations
- Data exposure
- Compliance concerns for data security 
- Encryption, access, and residency risks for comliance and data secuirty 

---

üìÅ You are provided with:

1. A `service` name (one of the following supported AWS services):
   - s3
   - rds
   - dynamodb
   - iam
   - ec2
   - lambda
   - ebs
   - efs
   - kms
   - glue
   - cloudtrail
   - vpc
   - redshift
   - stepfunctions
   - replication

2. A file `/Users/apple/Desktop/utility/data-security/aws_services_functions_list.json` containing `rule_id`s already implemented:
```json
[
  "s3_bucket_default_encryption",
  "s3_bucket_logging_enabled",
  "rds_storage_encrypted",
  ...
]
üéØ Your output must include:

rule_id: in snake_case (e.g., s3_bucket_policy_block_public)

title: Short and action-driven

description: Security value of the rule

capability: One of access_governance, data_protection, data_residency

service: The AWS service (e.g., s3, rds)

subservice: Focus area (e.g., encryption, acl, logging, replication)

risk: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW

existing: true if the rule is in /Users/apple/Desktop/utility/data-security/aws_services_functions_list.json, else false

üìö Capabilities & Expected Scope:

1. access_governance
IAM roles, policies, trust conditions

ACL/public access blocking

Bucket/resource policies

MFA delete

Logging visibility (CloudTrail, S3 logs)

Cross-account access

Conditional access (SourceIp, OrgID, VPC)

2. data_protection
Encryption (AES256, AWS-KMS, CMKs)

Secure transport (TLS, SecureTransport policies)

Object Lock, Versioning, WORM

KMS Key rotation, usage policies

Lifecycle, retention, and backup

3. data_residency
CRR and replication destination checks

Storage region enforcement (India, EU, etc.)

Transfer Acceleration disablement

Geo-tagging and data sovereignty

üì¶ Output Format (YAML):

Edit
- rule_id: s3_bucket_default_encryption
  title: Ensure default encryption on S3 buckets
  description: All S3 buckets must enforce SSE using AES256 or AWS-KMS to protect data at rest.
  capability: data_protection
  service: s3
  subservice: encryption
  risk: HIGH
  existing: true

- rule_id: s3_bucket_secure_transport_policy
  title: Enforce HTTPS-only access to S3 buckets
  description: Require all access to S3 to use TLS by enforcing aws:SecureTransport in bucket policies.
  capability: data_protection
  service: s3
  subservice: tls
  risk: HIGH
  existing: false
üí° Guidelines:


Mix of HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW risks

Avoid weak cosmetic-only checks unless tied to data exposure

Use real-world misconfig examples (CIS, NIST, AWS best practices)

Include both existing and new rules, using existing: true/false
